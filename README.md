### 💻 **Editor setup**

I used eslint for js linting, and prettier for code formating, make sure you install eslint and prettier plugins in your editor so you can
see linting errors as you code and have your code formatted on save by prettier. If formatOnSave doesn't work you can google how to set up
formatOnSave for the eslint & prettier plugins in your editor 🙃.
